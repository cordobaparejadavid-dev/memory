## How to run the project

This project uses local resources, so it cannot be opened directly by double-clicking index.html (it will cause CORS errors).

To run it correctly, it must be served from a local server.

### Option 1 – Live Server (VSCode)
1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Install the Live Server extension
3. Right-click html/index.html → Open with Live Server

### Option 2 – Python (without VSCode)
```bash
cd memory
python -m http.server
